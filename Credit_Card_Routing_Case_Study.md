## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

The retail industry has experienced growth in online transactions, with credit card payments becoming the primary mode of digital commerce. However, this growth has been accompanied by challenges in payment processing success rates. The subject company, one of the world's largest retail organizations, faces a business problem: a high failure rate of online credit card payments that has resulted in revenue losses and declining customer satisfaction.

Currently, transactions are processed through four different Payment Service Providers (PSPs) using a manual, rule-based routing system. This approach has proven inefficient, with an overall success rate of only 20.3%, meaning nearly 80% of attempted transactions fail. The analysis of 50,410 transactions from January-February 2019 in the DACH region confirms this challenge. The financial implications are severe - not only is potential revenue lost from failed transactions, but processing fees are also incurred for both successful and failed attempts.

The manual routing system lacks to consider multiple factors that influence transaction success, such as PSP performance by country, card type, transaction amount, or customer authentication status. This approach fails optimize the routing decisions in real-time.

### 1.2 Objective

The primary objective of this case study is to develop a data-driven solution for automating credit card routing through predictive modeling. The following aims are established:

1. **Increase Payment Success Rate**: Improve the overall transaction success rate by at least 10% through PSP routing
2. **Minimize Transaction Costs**: Optimize PSP selection to reduce overall transaction fees while maintaining or improving success rates
3. **Enhance Customer Experience**: Reduce failed transactions to improve customer satisfaction and retention
4. **Provide Business Intelligence**: Deliver insights and monitoring capabilities for ongoing optimization

This case study demonstrates the practical application of machine learning techniques to solve a business problem, showcasing the end-to-end process from problem identification to deployment recommendation.

## 6. Modeling

### 6.1 Preparing Data for Machine Learning

**Model Design Philosophy:**
The modeling approach focused on developing predictive models to optimize PSP routing decisions. The objective was to predict transaction success probability for different PSPs to enable data-driven routing decisions.

**Model Architecture Strategy:**
A two-tier modeling approach was implemented:

**Tier 1: Baseline Models**
Three rule-based strategies were developed to establish performance benchmarks:
- **Strategy 1**: Always use best performing PSP (Goldcard)
- **Strategy 2**: Country-specific best PSP routing
- **Strategy 3**: Amount-based PSP selection using transaction value categories

**Tier 2: Machine Learning Models**
Four machine learning algorithms were implemented and compared:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

### 6.2 Building the Model

**Baseline Model Results:**
Based on the notebook implementation, four distinct baseline strategies were developed and evaluated:

**Strategy 1: Always Best**
- **Rule**: Route all transactions to highest success rate PSP (Goldcard)
- **Business Logic**: Simple success-rate maximization; conservative approach
- **PSPs Used**: Goldcard only (40.6% success rate)
- **Expected Outcome**: Highest success rates but high transaction costs

**Strategy 2: Cost-Country**
- **Rules**: 1) Amount < €100 → Cheapest PSP (Simplecard), 2) Country-specific best PSP, 3) Fallback to best PSP (Goldcard)
- **Business Logic**: Hierarchical decision tree: Cost optimization → Geography → Success
- **PSPs Used**: Simplecard (€1.00), country-specific PSPs, Goldcard (fallback)
- **Expected Outcome**: Reduced costs for small transactions, maintained performance for large

**Strategy 3: Risk-Based**
- **Rules**: 1) >€500 OR Diners card → Best PSP (Goldcard), 2) €200-500 → Second-best PSP (Moneycard), 3) <€200 → Cheapest PSP (Simplecard)
- **Business Logic**: 3-tier risk assessment with gradual cost-performance tradeoff
- **PSPs Used**: Goldcard (high-risk), Moneycard (medium-risk), Simplecard (low-risk)
- **Expected Outcome**: Balanced performance with risk-appropriate allocation

**Strategy 4: Hybrid Value**
- **Rules**: 1) Top 20% transaction amounts → Best PSP (Goldcard), 2) Bottom 80% → Cheapest PSP (Simplecard)
- **Business Logic**: Binary high-stakes vs. low-stakes optimization using dynamic 80th percentile threshold
- **PSPs Used**: Goldcard (high-value), Simplecard (low-value)
- **Expected Outcome**: Clear cost savings for majority, protection for high-value transactions

**Baseline Strategy Comparison:**

| Dimension | Strategy 1 | Strategy 2 | Strategy 3 | Strategy 4 |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Complexity** | Simple | Medium | High | Medium |
| **Segmentation** | None | Geographic + Amount | Risk-based | Value-based |
| **PSP Variety** | 1 PSP | 2-3 PSPs | 3 PSPs | 2 PSPs |
| **Decision Criteria** | Success only | Cost + Geography | Risk + Amount + Card | Value percentile |
| **Special Cases** | None | Country rules | Diners cards | Dynamic threshold |
| **Optimization Focus** | Success-first | Cost-conscious | Risk-balanced | Binary optimization |

**Machine Learning Model Development:**

Based on the notebook implementation, four machine learning models were developed and evaluated:

**1. Logistic Regression:**
- **Performance**: 79.8% accuracy, 0.622 AUC score
- **Characteristics**: Linear model providing interpretable coefficients

**2. Random Forest Classifier:**
- **Performance**: 75.5% accuracy, 0.619 AUC score  
- **Characteristics**: Ensemble method with good feature importance insights

**3. Gradient Boosting Classifier:**
- **Performance**: 79.9% accuracy, 0.659 AUC score
- **Characteristics**: Best performing model with sequential learning approach

**4. XGBoost Classifier:**
- **Performance**: 79.1% accuracy, 0.646 AUC score
- **Characteristics**: Advanced gradient boosting implementation

**Feature Importance Analysis:**
Analysis of the best performing model (Gradient Boosting) revealed the most influential features for PSP routing decisions:

**Top 10 Most Important Features:**
1. **amount_log** (0.121) - Log-transformed transaction amount is the strongest predictor
2. **PSP_encoded** (0.109) - PSP selection significantly impacts success probability
3. **3D_secured** (0.087) - Authentication status strongly influences transaction success
4. **minutes_since_last_attempt** (0.085) - Time between retry attempts affects success rates
5. **psp_success_fee** (0.085) - PSP fee structure impacts routing optimization
6. **amount** (0.084) - Raw transaction amount remains highly predictive
7. **psp_failure_fee** (0.072) - Failure costs influence PSP selection logic
8. **hour** (0.071) - Time of day patterns affect transaction success
9. **day_of_month** (0.052) - Monthly timing patterns show predictive value
10. **psp_historical_success_rate** (0.047) - Historical PSP performance guides routing

**Business Insights from Feature Importance:**
- **Transaction Amount**: Both raw and log-transformed amounts are critical, indicating non-linear relationships between transaction value and success rates
- **PSP-Related Features**: PSP identity and fee structure account for high predictive power, confirming the business hypothesis about PSP optimization potential
- **Authentication**: 3D secure status emerges as a key success factor, suggesting security measures significantly impact approval rates
- **Temporal Patterns**: Hour and day-of-month features indicate timing affects payment processing success
